    <h3>Manual Testing Completed</h3>
    <p>1. When the users first start to use the application, they will see a term of service button when they open the APP,
      and if they click the button, they are able to click a checkbox to agree on it and click the button at top right conner to close it.
      Only if the checkbox is clicked can the users see the log in button
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Clicking log in will direct the user to a page where they can log in or sign up for an account. The process is supported by a
      third party called clerk. We have tried both using google and email address to log in and both worked.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      3. After signing in, the button "Exercise" is tested and it directs the user to the code exercise page. The button "Results Review" 
      is tested and successfully directs the users to the performance review page. The button "Log out" is tested and correctly log out the users to let
      them see the page where there is the term of service button
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      4. The submit button is tested and is working correctly since we are able to click submit button and get expected result (user inputs can be viewed from the backend console,
      which means submit button does trigger the right functionality)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>5. The "Go to the Main Page" buttons at the bottom of the performance review page and at the bottom of the result page where the users are directed to 
      when they finished the quiz are tested, and are directing users to the right page
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
      6. The rows of the table at the performance review page are tested to be clickable, and direct the users to the page where more detailed quiz result of that
      specific quiz listed in that row correctly. Also, the button "Go to Performance Review" is tested and directs user to the right page.
